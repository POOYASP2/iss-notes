# OSI recap

## Here are some networking recaps. I’m trying to cover everything I need for ISS.

No we have devices fro networking.

1.  Repeater: amplifies the signal (regenerates).
2.  Hub: multi-port repeaters (broadcasting).
3.  Bridge: sit between hub-connected hosts.
    1.  Only has two ports.
    2.  learns which hosts are on each side.
4.  Switches: combination of hubs and bridges. facilitate communication **within** a network.
    1.  multi ports.
    2.  learns which hosts are on each port.
5.  Router: facilitate communication **between** networks.
    1.  provide traffic control point (security, filtering, redirecting)
    2.  routers have **routing tables** which are used for all the networks a router knows about.
